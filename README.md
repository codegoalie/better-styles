# Better Styles

Browser extension to tweak styles on certain sites

## Usage

Download the XPI from the [releases page](https://github.com/codegoalie/better-styles/releases)

## Development

`better-styles` uses [`web-ext`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)
for easy management of browser extensions. You can execute `web-ext run` from
the root of this repo to launch a browser with the extension intalled. Updating
any file in this repo will automatically reload the extension in that test
browser instance.

## Contributing

Feel free to open a PR to this repo with updates, tweaks, and additional styles.

Thanks!
